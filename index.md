## Covid 19 in the USA Final Report

This page is meant to serve as the final report of our team's Covid Visualization project for INLS 641. 


### Team Goals

Our team originally wanted to just visualize how the United States had been affected by the COVID-19 throughout the time since the pandemic began. However, soon after the initial proposal, we wanted to expand this visualization into highlighting racial disparities that were occuring in the healthcare system, which in turn point to a larger problem of racial disparity across the United States. 

Our project was intended to be for several audiences. The first being for general public information. We wanted to allow for people to track how covid was affecting each of their states, but also wanted there to be information for each demographic in their state as well to highlight racial discrepancies. The other audience we wanted to reach is public health officials. A visualization that highlights where racial disparities are most severe will help these officials identify where there is a higher need for nurses and doctors to focus their time and energy on. 

Ultimately for both of these groups, we wanted the visualization to get people to start thinking about this question: **Which  races are more heavily affected by Covid-19 then others and why?**
